introduction: |-
  <p>Welcome to Easy PQT! </p>
  <p>A user-friendly app to import your annotated benthic photo quadrat transect (PQT) data into MERMAID.</p>
  <p>Easy PQT is designed to help you import your PQT data that has been annotated in <b>CoralNet</b> or <b>ReefCloud</b> into MERMAID in just a few steps:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><a href="https://datamermaid.org/documentation/collect-project-set-up" target="_blank" >Prepare your project</a> in <a href="https://app.datamermaid.org/" target="_blank">MERMAID Collect</a></li>
  <li>Export your data from CoralNet or ReefCloud</li>
  <li>Upload to Easy PQT</li>
  <li>Import into MERMAID</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Please read our <a href="https://datamermaid.org/documentation/mermaid-easy-pqt-data-import" target="_blank">step-by-step guide to using Easy PQT</a> before starting to import your data using Easy PQT.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Selecting a MERMAID project for your data import.</li>
      <li>Uploading your CoralNet image annotations.</li> <li>Matching CoralNet auxiliary fields to required MERMAID fields.</li>
      <li>Assigning CoralNet labels to MERMAID benthic attributes and growth forms. Most CoralNet labels have already been pre‑assigned to MERMAID benthic attributes and growth forms to make importing as easy as possible.</li>
