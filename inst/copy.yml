title: Easy PQT
loading: Loading Easy PQT...
preamble: <p>Welcome to Easy PQT! Easy PQT is designed to help you ingest your Benthic
  Photo Quadrat data exported from CoralNet into MERMAID.</p> <p> Easy PQT will walk
  you through selecting a MERMAID project to ingest into, uploading your CoralNet
  image annotations, matching CoralNet auxiliary fields to required MERMAID fields,
  and mapping CoralNet labels to MERMAID Benthic Attributes and Growth Forms. We've
  pre-mapped most of the labels in CoralNet to MERMAID's Benthic Attributes and Growth
  Forms in order to make the ingestion process as easy as possible. </p> <p> Please
  note that after you have successfully ingested your data, there is still information
  that needs to be filled out, including the mandatory fields of depth, transect length
  surveyed, quadrat size, number of points per quadrat, and observers. </p> <p> To
  begin, please make sure your project is set up in MERMAID (with Sites and Managements)
  and that your CoralNet data includes auxiliary fields that correspond to your MERMAID
  Sites and Managements, as well as Transect numbers and dates for each image. You
  will need to upload the image annotations file obtained directly from CoralNet,
  including the date and auxiliary fields columns.

upload_data:
  title: Upload CoralNet annotations
  text: <p>Upload your data by clicking the "Browse..." button or by dragging the
    file directly into the upload field. </p> <p> Please ensure your data is the annotations
    file exported directly from CoralNet, including the date and auxiliary fields
    columns.
  instructions: The image annotations file can be found by navigating to "Images"
    within a CoralNet project. Under "Image Actions", select "Export Annotations,
    CSV", and select the optional columns "Image metadata - date and auxiliary fields",
    as shown below.
  instructions_img_alt: 'A screen shot of the "Image" page in CoralNet, highlighting
    the "Image Actions" section with the Action: "Export Annotations, CSV" for these
    images: "All N image results" selected. The instructions read "Export annotations
    for these images in CSV format - one row per annotation". There is a section to
    select Optional Columns, and the option "Image metadata - date and auxiliary fields"
    is checked.'
  missing_instructions: The uploaded annotations do not contain the required columns.
  invalid_instructions: The uploaded annotations contain some invalid values for <b>Date</b>. Using
    the instructions below, please export the annotations file from CoralNet and upload
    it directly into Easy PQT without making any changes to it.
non_empty_fields: |-
  {fields} cannot contain empty values. The following fields contain empty values: {list}
  Please update the data directly in CoralNet then begin the ingestion process again.
transect_number_not_integer: 'Transect Number must be an integer. The following are
  invalid: {invalid_values}'
invalid_values: |-
  The annotations contain invalid values of {label}. The following are invalid: {invalid_values}
  Valid values of {label} are: {valid_values}
auxiliary:
  title: Match CoralNet auxiliary fields
  text: In this section, you will match the auxiliary fields in your CoralNet annotations
    to the fields that are required to ingest your data to MERMAID. Select the auxiliary
    fields that correspond to Site, Management, and Transect number. After matching
    columns, Easy PQT will validate the data to ensure it matches the available options
    in your MERMAID project. If it does not, you will receive information on which
    fields do not match,
  preview: Auxiliary fields preview
  preview_text: The following table shows the auxiliary fields in your uploaded CoralNet
    annotations. Use this information to help match Site, Management, and Transect
    number to auxiliary fields, below.
  map: Match auxiliary fields
  map_text: Choose the auxiliary field for Site, Management, and Transect number using
    the inputs below.
  placeholder: Select an auxiliary field
auxiliary_validating:

  checking: Checking auxiliary fields...
  all_valid: <p>✔ All auxiliary fields are valid! </p><p> Continue on to map CoralNet
    labels to MERMAID attributes.</p>
  column_valid: ✔ Values of {column} are valid.
  fix: <p>There are some issues with the auxiliary column values, as described below.
    You may need to fix invalid values in CoralNet, or add/edit values (Site or Management)
    in the MERMAID app to match the CoralNet annotations.</p><p>Once you have made
    changes, please restart Easy PQT before continuing with ingestion.</p>
mapping:
  title: Map CoralNet Labels to MERMAID Attributes
  text: <p>This section will help you map CoralNet labels to MERMAID Benthic Attributes
    and Growth Forms. We have pre-mapped many CoralNet labels to attributes in MERMAID.
    If you have a CoralNet label that is not mapped to an attribute, it will appear
    as an empty value. </p><p> Note that Growth Form can remain empty, but Benthic
    Attribute is a required field. Blank Benthic Attributes are highlighted in red
    to indicate that they must be mapped before you can continue. Please select the
    correct Benthic Attributes and/or Growth Forms by selecting the correct value
    from the dropdown list for each field. </p><p> Once all CoralNet labels are mapped
    to valid MERMAID Benthic Attributes, you can click the "Confirm" button to continue
    with the ingestion process.</p>
  not_allowed_to_confirm: All CoralNet labels must be mapped to valid MERMAID Benthic
    Attributes to continue.
