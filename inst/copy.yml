title: Easy PQT
loading: Loading Easy PQT...
preamble: Welcome to Easy PQT! Easy PQT is designed to help you import your benthic photo quadrat data exported from CoralNet. We've mapped most of the labels in CoralNet to MERMAID's Benthic attributes and Growth forms. Please note that after you successfully imported your data, there is still information that needs to be filled, especially the mandatory fields such as depth, transect length surveyed, quadrat number start, quadrat size, number of quadrats, number of points per quadrat, and observers.

upload_data:
  title: Upload CoralNet annotations
  text: 'Upload your data by clicking the "Browse..." button. Please ensure your data is in a Comma Separated Value (CSV) format (link for saving data to CSV: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-a-workbook-to-text-format-txt-or-csv-3e9a9d6c-70da-4255-aa28-fcacf1f081e6).'
  missing_instructions: The uploaded annotations do not contain the required columns.
    To get the correct data from CoralNet, export the annotations as a CSV with the
    optional columns "Image metadata - date and auxiliary fields" checked, as shown
    below.
  missing_img_alt: 'A screen shot of the "Image Actions" screen in CoralNet, showing
    the Action: "Export Annotations, CSV" for these images: "All N image results".
    The instructions read "Export annotations for these images in CSV format - one
    row per annotation". There is a section to select Optional Columns, and the option
    "Image metadata - date and auxiliary fields" is checked.'
non_empty_fields: |-
  {fields} cannot contain empty values. The following fields contain empty values: {list}
  Please update the data directly in CoralNet then begin the import process again.
transect_number_not_integer: 'Transect Number must be an integer. The following are
  invalid: {invalid_values}'
invalid_values: |-
  The annotations contain invalid values of {label}. The following are invalid: {invalid_values}
  Valid values of {label} are: {valid_values}
auxiliary:
  title: Map CoralNet auxiliary fields
  text: In this section, you will need to map your auxiliary fields to match the fields that are required to import your data to MERMAID. After selecting the right column, MERMAID will validate your data to make sure it matches the available options in your project. Make sure that the Site and Management regime in your data are available in your project. After you receive a message "All auxiliary fields are valid!", then you're good to go.

  preview_text: Here's what your data look like
  map: Map auxiliary fields
  map_text: Choose the right auxiliary field that has Site, Management, and Transect number data by selecting from the dropdown list for each field.
  placeholder: Select an auxiliary field
auxiliary_validating:
  title: Validating fields
  checking: Checking auxiliary fields...
  all_valid: ✔ All auxiliary fields are valid!
  column_valid: ✔ Values of {column} are valid.
  fix: There are some issues with the auxiliary column values, as described below.
    Please fix invalid values in CoralNet before continuing.
mapping:
  title: "Map CoralNet Labels to MERMAID Attributes"
  text: This section will match CoralNet labels to MERMAID benthic attributes and growth forms. If a label is not listed in MERMAID's database, an empty field highlighted with red will appear next to the unknown label. Please choose the right benthic attributes and/or growth forms by clicking the field and type and choose the right benthic attribute and/or growth form from the drop-down list then click "Confirm" when ready.
