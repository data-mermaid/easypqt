introduction: <p>Welcome to Easy PQT! Easy PQT is designed to help you ingest your
  Benthic Photo Quadrat data exported from CoralNet or ReefCloud into MERMAID.</p>

provider_introduction:
  coralnet: <p> Easy PQT will walk you through selecting a MERMAID project to ingest
    into, uploading your CoralNet image annotations, matching CoralNet auxiliary fields
    to required MERMAID fields, and mapping CoralNet labels to MERMAID Benthic Attributes
    and Growth Forms. We've pre-mapped most of the labels in CoralNet to MERMAID's
    Benthic Attributes and Growth Forms in order to make the ingestion process as
    easy as possible. </p> <p> Please note that after you have successfully ingested
    your data, there is still information that needs to be filled out, including the
    mandatory fields of depth, transect length surveyed, quadrat size, number of points
    per quadrat, and observers. </p> <p> To begin, please make sure your project is
    set up in MERMAID (with Sites and Managements) and that your CoralNet data includes
    auxiliary fields that correspond to your MERMAID Sites and Managements, as well
    as Transect numbers and dates for each image. You will need to upload the image
    annotations file obtained directly from CoralNet, including the date and auxiliary
    fields columns.
  reefcloud: <p> Easy PQT will walk you through selecting a MERMAID project to ingest
    into, uploading your ReefCloud image annotations, matching ReefCloud fields to
    required MERMAID fields, and mapping ReefCloud labels to MERMAID Benthic Attributes
    and Growth Forms. We've pre-mapped most of the labels in ReefCloud to MERMAID's
    Benthic Attributes and Growth Forms in order to make the ingestion process as
    easy as possible. </p> <p> Please note that after you have successfully ingested
    your data, there is still information that needs to be filled out, including the
    mandatory fields of transect length surveyed, quadrat size, number of points per
    quadrat, and observers. </p> <p> To begin, please make sure your project is set
    up in MERMAID (with Sites and Managements) and that your ReefCloud data Sites
    and Managements match these, as well as Transect numbers and dates for each image.
    You will need to upload the point classifications file obtained directly from
    ReefCloud.

  instructions:
    coralnet: The image annotations file can be found by navigating to "Images" within
      a CoralNet project. Under "Image Actions", select "Export Annotations, CSV".
      Select "Both" for the Label format, and select the optional columns "Image metadata
      - date and auxiliary fields", as shown below.
    reefcloud: The classifications file can be found by selecting "Export point classifications"
      in the dashboard of a CoralNet project. De-select "Only Include Human Annotatable
      Points", then click "Export", as shown below.
